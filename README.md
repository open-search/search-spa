# Open Search SPA

This is an example app using React to interface with our open search elastic api.

## Configuration

In the ```constants``` folder at the root is a JSON file containing various settings. Use this to change the title of the site etc.

## Build

The docker compose Nginx will look for a build folder so that needs to be run first.

```
npm run build
```

## Test

```
npm run test
```
